    <h2>Dr. Peter G. Hanson, MD – Whistler</h2><img class="doctorleft" src="img/peter.jpg" alt="PeterHanson"/>
<p>Dr. Hanson is returning to his BC origins after a career in Toronto and Denver Colorado. He will be working full time at the Coast Medical Clinic Whistler, and will become a permanent fixture in Whistler year-round.
He was the team doctor for the Toronto Argonauts, before writing the international bestseller “The Joy of Stress”. He moved to Denver Colorado, where he was one of the doctors for the Denver Broncos of the NFL, as well as the Colorado Avalanche and the Los Angeles Kings of the NHL. He also looked after the Colorado Rapids of the MLS. He specializes in sports medicine using trigger point injections without cortisone. These use just a few drops of local anesthetic, and takes his expertise in acupuncture to a new level. Ideal for acute headaches or injuries to the back or neck, or for muscle knots in the limbs. These treatments offer a quick response with no side effects. Once these muscle knots are treated, it is much easier for the patient to enjoy the full benefits of physio, massage, and chiropractic as needed, and to return to exercise promptly.
Dr. Hanson also treats urgent care patients, including general family medicine, sutures, as well minor orthopedic procedures.
In season, he also offers hotel visits for private patients.</p></div>
